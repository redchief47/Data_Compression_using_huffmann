# Data_Compression_using_huffmann
This project implements lossless data compression using Huffman Coding, one of the most efficient entropy encoding algorithms. Huffman coding reduces the overall storage size by assigning shorter codes to frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent ones, making it widely used in compression standards like JPEG, MP3, and PNG.

The project supports:

Compression of text and image data.

Decompression to restore the original data.

Visualization of Huffman trees for better understanding.

GUI (Tkinter) support for easy interaction (optional).

⚙️ Features

1. Lossless compression – no data loss.

2. Efficient encoding – based on character frequency.

3. Huffman Tree visualization (optional).

4. GUI Support – drag-and-drop files, preview, and file size viewer.

5. Works with both text files and image files.

🚀 How It Works

1. Frequency Analysis – Count frequency of each symbol in input.

2. Huffman Tree Construction – Build a binary tree based on frequencies.

3. Code Assignment – Assign binary codes (shorter for frequent symbols).

4. Encoding – Replace symbols with their Huffman codes.

5. Decoding – Use the Huffman Tree to decode the compressed data back.
